        <td>  London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[7][8] Standing on the River
            Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North
            Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia
            . Londinium was founded by the Romans.[9] The City of London,
            London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and
            colloquially known as the Square Mile −
            retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval
            limits.[10][11][12][13][14][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status. London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly</td>
